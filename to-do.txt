Make variant of or replace CSAT with FIA Files to edit:
	Edit server initialisation stuff: Lines 341/2 (init.sqf)
	Edit function: AW_fnc_spawnUnits (init.sqf)
	Edit AO Detection trigger: Lines 821-5 (init.sqf)
	Edit other spawning stuff, priority targets? Possibly make it either mortar site or sam site (that'll be a laugh)
	Implement weapons as rewards for completing missions
