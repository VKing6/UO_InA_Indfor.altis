		<br/>A note on ACRE radios:
		<br/>If you pick up a 148 without removing the 343 from the item slot at the bottom of the inventory, it will overwrite it. To avoid this, remove your 343 from the item slot before picking up a 148 from the ammo box.
		<br/>
		<br/>Most vehicles respawn after being abandoned for 60 minutes.
		<br/>
		<br/>The CRV can be used to service ground vehicles in the field. The trucks can be used to service all vehicles.
		<br/>
		<br/>This mission uses standard medical.
